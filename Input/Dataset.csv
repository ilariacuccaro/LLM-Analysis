1,How artificial intelligence will change the future of marketing,"The application of Artificial intelligence in marketing is in order to continuously follow and anticipate the next purchasing decisions of the target consumers. Machine learning allows marketers to understand and draw logical conclusions from large data collections. In the following years, marketers can expect greater impact of Artificial Intelligent, through refined content delivery, preventing fraud and data breaches, image and voice recognition, sales forecast and predictive customer service. In the transportation industry, driverless, AI-enabled cars may be just around the corner, promising to alter both business models and customer behavior; demand for automobile insurance and breathalyzers (fewer people will drive, especially after drinking) will likely diminish, whereas demand for security systems that protect cars from being hacked will increase. Driverless vehicles could positive impact, because cars can move at faster speeds, and so commute times will reduce and more productive for passengers, who can safely work while being driven to their destination.  AI will affect sales processes in various industries. Most salespeople still rely on a telephone call as a critical part of the sales process. In the future, salespeople will be assisted by an AI agent that monitors tele-conversations in real time, the danger remains that if customers discover that they are interacting with a bot, they may become uncomfortable, triggering negative consequences. With AI, online retailers may be able to predict what customers will want. The three use cases illustrate why so many academics and practitioners anticipate that AI will change the face of marketing strategies and customer behaviors. In fact, a survey by Salesforce shows that AI will be the technology most adopted by marketers in the coming years.

2,How Does Facebook Use Machine Learning to Deliver Ads?,"Delivering personalized ads maximizes value for both people and businesses. Advertisers select their target audience based on factors such as age, gender, and user interactions, this approach ensures targeted and efficient advertising. Facebook is a social network platform, created in 2004 to share posts, images and videos with your contacts. It uses machine learning to generate the estimated action rate and the ad quality score used in the total value equation. To find the estimated action rate, machine learning models use predictive analytics to deduce the a particular person’s likelihood of taking the advertiser’s desired action, based on the business objective the advertiser selects for their ad, like increasing visits to their website or driving purchases. To do this, our models consider that person's behavior while using Facebook app, considering the feedback of people viewing or hiding the ad. The advertiser’s bid, the estimated action rate and the ad quality score are combined to calculate the ad’s total value score in the ad auction. Over time, as more people view an ad, share feedback on it or click through to make a purchase on an advertiser’s website, our models get better at predicting the estimated action rate and ad quality."
3,Spotify personalizes audio experiences with machine learning,"In 2008, the Spotify platform incorporated machine learning into its business model, transitioning from user curated playlists to Machine Learning driven recommendations. Tony Jebara, Spotify's VP of Engineering and Head of Machine Learning, outlined the company's Machine Learning approach at the MIT Technology Review's EmTech Digital conference. Spotify utilized raw data from playlists, user listening behaviors, audio analytics, and browsing patterns to build ML models. These models employ techniques like collaborative filtering to map content and users into a high-dimensional vector space, facilitating personalized playlist creation. Consumers using the platform during the early stages of Spotify mainly curated their own playlists and organized their own content mix.  To build a machine learning approach to audio personalization, Spotify invested in data, modeling and experience building. The audio streaming provider used raw data from playlists, listening behaviors from users, content, audio analytics and information gained from what users are browsing and skipping through. Using that data, Spotify built machine learning models to understand the similarities between specific pieces of music or podcasts, and what content users prefer."
